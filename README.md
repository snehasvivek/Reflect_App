## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Project Title: REFLECT 

Project Description:
REFLECT is an mobile app aimed at giving users resources to become more reflective.

Project Description:
Amidst a busy schedule, most people find it difficult to be mindful. REFLECT aims to aid in mindfulness by making certain practices more accessible. While users are on the go, they have the opportunity to reflect through the use of this app. The app has 3 main features to aid in self-reflections. The first is a daily journal prompt that allows the user to enter their thoughts concerning the given prompt. The next feature is a habit tracker that allows users to create and track habits, resetting daily and tracking practice through a heat map that allows the user to see how well they have kept with their habits. Finally, the app also has a meditation time that allows the user to set a specific time that they would like to meditate.

How to Run the Project:
To run the project, please use either Android Studio or VSCode, and choose the desired emulator. You will then be able to access the application and its various components.

How to Use the Project:
There are three parts to the project. The first part is the journal page of the application. At the top of the page is the journal prompt and below that is a textbox that allows the user to enter their thoughts on the prompt. The next button allows for the user to track their habits. On this page, the user is able to check or uncheck each habit to track their progress. The plus button can be used to crete new habits. For each habit, the habit square can be swiped to allow the user to edit or delete each of the habits. For this page, the user can see their progress being tracked on the calendar at the top of the page using a heat map calendar. Finally, the user can click the last button on the navigator and allows the user to view and start a 30-second timer.
